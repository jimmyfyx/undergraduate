# OpenCV Independent Study
This repository contains all the scripts I write when learning OpenCV independently (until Spring 2023).

This repository can be devided into the following parts:
  - `\tutorial_scripts`: scripts about basic OpenCV functions and use
  - `\face_detection`: demonstration about OpenCV built-in face detector
  - `\Faces` and `\Photos`: image resources
  - `\file_scanning_project`: a mini project implemented with OpenCV. More details in the folder.

**1/10/2023 Update** 2022 winter break scripts added
