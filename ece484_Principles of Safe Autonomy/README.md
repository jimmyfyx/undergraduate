# ECE484 Principles of Safe Autonomy (Spring 2024)
This course serves as an introduction to the autonomy pipeline, including basic algorithms for building autonomous systems (e.g., path planning, particle filtering, lane detection, and safety verification).  <br/>
MPs in this course require students to get familiar with ROS and Gazebo when developing different algorithms. There is a final project which allows us to deploy autonomy algorithms (lane following) on the F1-tenth car. Details can be found in `\project_src`.
