# Yixiao's Coding Base
This repository contains most of my written codes as a undergraduate at UIUC (2020 - 2024) and is constituted by the following parts: 
  - Code from taken courses. The folder names are the course number followed by the course name.
  - `\pytorch_summer2022`. Independent study on Pytorch and deep learning during Summer 2022.
  - `\OpenCV`. Scripts from independent study on OpenCV (until Spring 2023).

More details can be found in each folder.
